This project presents an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on hotel booking data for **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel**.  
The dataset contains booking information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, number of guests, and cancellation details.

## 📘 Problem Statement

The dataset includes booking details for a **city hotel** and a **resort hotel**, with features like booking date, stay duration, number of adults/children, and cancellation status.  
All personally identifiable information has been removed.  
The goal is to **explore and analyze** the data to discover key factors that govern hotel bookings.

## 🔍 Our Approach

We followed a structured process to clean and analyze the data:

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing/null values and prepared the data for analysis.  
2. **Data Separation** – Created separate datasets for City Hotel and Resort Hotel.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize insights.
